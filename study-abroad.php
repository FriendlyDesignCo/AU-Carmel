            <p>The Initiative for Russian Culture's 2015 summer class trip to Russia will explore "Literary Russia" through nine short stories by nine great writers. Professor Anton Fedyashin will take ten students to visit the most significant cultural sites in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and beyond, which students will explore through the context of the short stories. Students will explore these texts through daily seminars after visiting museums, galleries, and places that appear in the short stories themselves. This will be a 3-credit course open to all graduate and undergraduate students within the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Selection will be based on academic merit and the quality of applicant responses. The course will culminate in a paper exploring one of the short stories in its historical context.</p>
